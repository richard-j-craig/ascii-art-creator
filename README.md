This repository contains the code for a simple React application which provides the user with a GUI for creating ascii art. It can be accessed at: [http://asciiartcreator.com](http://asciiartcreator.com).

The application is hosted on an AWS S3 bucket that has been enabled to host a website, with Route53 being used to route requests from a custom domain to the bucket.
